# MTImageMapView, HTML map-like image map view

## How to create an image map

1. Use tools like [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) and generate map.
2. Copy only coordinates (e.g. "123,242,452,242,142,322") and put them in an NSArray.
3. Pass the array to map view.

P.S it's 3:10 AM and I am almost zombified already. I will put thorough detail tommorow. :(
